		<h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>

		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>For this website for a land development company, I looked to Mortenson (<a href="http://www.mortenson.com/">www.mortenson.com</a>) as well as Westbank (<a href="http://westbankcorp.com/">westbankcorp.com</a>).</p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p>Both websites incorporate a beautifully modern and balanced style through generous use of white space and a modular take on a grid. Images fit within each website's brand aesthetic nicely, and the use of text is clear and indicative of the information type it is (headline, body copy, etc).</p>
			
		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>Both websites have complex sitemaps and architecture, but whereas Mortenson introduces with a simple set of rotating full-screen background images and headlines, Westbank puts their architectural portfolio on full display in a cascading set of images down a long, 3D-animated home page. Both websites make use of a large dropdown master menu, but whereas Mortenson only relies on this method for one subset of information as a bridge between two complete sets of architectures (each subgroup within "Work" forms essentially a mini website within the larger one), Westcorp relies on the dropdown to excess, and thus negates some of its helpful qualities through confusing navigation.</p>

		<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>
		<p>I played with a number of different types of grid structures, from very basic full-width text to evenly spaced 3 or 6-column grids and even played around with a less strict grid, with overlapping images. I used a big headline for H1 and smaller headlines for H2 placement. I kept a consistent logo and main nav throughout. I also kept to similar layouts for v1 of each version and then a second set of layouts for the v2's. I did the home pages last and let go of my primary focus on content placement and played more with a visually striking layout.</p>
